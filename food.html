    <h3>My <b>Favorite</b> Pizza Places:</h3>
    <p1>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Ian's Pizza</b></dt><dd>Ian's pepperoni pizza is one of the yummiest pizzas ever, I enjoy the plainness of the crust which acts as a palate cleanse when transitioning from one piece to another. Ian's pizza sauce is sweeter than normal which is probably my favorite part.</dd>
            <dt><b>MOD Pizza</b></dt><dd>MOD pizza is a classic. I enjoy the amount of variety you can choose for such a little price. I always get garlic on my MOD pizza and that flavor solidifies the loveliness of each slice.</dd>
            <dt><b>Pizza Hut</b></dt><dd>Pizza Hut is my go to for quick, cheap, easy access pizza. I love the crispiness of their pepperoni, Pizza Hut is all around an wonderful choice for the price.</dd>
            <dt><b>Giordano's</b></dt><dd>I could not not include classic Giordano's deep dish in my list of favorites. My personal top rated Chicago pizza, a classic, thats all I have to say.</dd>
